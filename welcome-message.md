Welcome to OpenStreetMap, the world's open-source map.

You've just joined a community of over one million contributors who are creating a free, worldwide map. Welcome!

To introduce you to OpenStreetMap, we have compiled a [guide](http://en.flossmanuals.net/openstreetmap/introduction-to-editing-in-openstreetmap/) with lots of information about mapping and the OpenStreetMap community. We hope you find this useful!

If you have questions that our guide does not cover, help is always close at hand on our [Questions & Answers web site](https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/?sort=mostvoted). 

Happy mapping!
