Welcome Message
===============

Organizing the work around sending new mappers (semi) automated messages. 

Eventually folks would be able to clone this repository, tweak the message and some settings, and be ready to start sending messages to new mappers!

This work consists of three things:

1) The Message - the text of the message itself, which should be tailored to the locale.
2) The Process - A solid description of what someone should do in order to start sending new messages to users. 
3) The Tech - The code to actually track new users.

Do you want to help out? Great! Please get in touch with one of the [owners](https://github.com/organizations/osm-wwg/teams/359760) to be added to the OSM-WWG GitHub organization. 
The OSM Welcome Working Group meets weekly on Thursday. See the [WWG wiki page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Mvexel/Welcome_Working_Group) for details.
